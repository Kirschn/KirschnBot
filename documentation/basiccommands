Basic commands - KirschnBot Modguide

Add commands:
!addcom !yourcommand Your Command Text

This will create the command !yourcommand with the return text "Your Command Text". No Userlevel is supplied, so the userlevel for normal regular users will be used, everyone will be able to use it.
To set an custom userlevel you need to supply a userlevel parameter:
!addcom -ul=mod !yourcommand Your Command Text
Only Moderators will be able to use this command. You can use descriptors for your groups, but also the numeric userlevel:
!addcom -ul=100 !yourcommand Your Command Text

Edit commands:
You can also easily edit your Command Return or Userlevel with the !editcom command:
!editcom text !yourcommand This is your new command text
...or:
!editcom userlevel !yourcommand moderator
Like in the !addcom -ul syntax you can use descriptors or numeric levels.

Delete Command:
!removecom !yourcommand

Available Variables:
$query - Returns everything the user wrote after the !command
$user - Returns the username of the user, who executed the command
$[http(https://google.com)] - returns the google.com source code
$rnglist(listname) - returns a random item from the defined list
$rngnumber(min,max) - returns a random number between min and max
$[index] - returns specific word in the trigger message (for example:
    Commandtext: $user gives some help to $[1]
    Trigger message: !mycom everyone
    Bot return: (username) gives some help to everyone
NOTE: the "else" variable is triggered, if the query word isn't available!
$[index]elserngnumber(min,max) - should be self explainatory
$[index]elsernglist(min,max)
$queryelseuser
$queryelsernglist(listname)
And so on... You should have understood the principle :)
